# Solar App
I make my own solar technology.   I want to be able to use my phone and somehow be able to read my battery level as well as other information such as output from specific panels. This repository will act to achieve this task.  

## Scripting Language
HTML, JS, CSS, C(for BLE stuffs)

## Target Platform(s)
Release: Windows 8.1 mobile, Windows 10, Windows 10 mobile, 
Later: IE11, Chrome, FF

## UI
1. Hub layout with drop menus.
2. Readouts: battery level, solar input, load output
3. Pages: Input, Output, and HUB

issues: 
* Is it possible to toggle the load from the regulator to the inverter via bluetooth?
* Can we remotely switch battery banks? (i'm considering having two battery banks so while one is charging, the other one is in use)

## BLE Board and other BLE information:
-notice- totally unsure on what to do as far as developing this module.  I think i have a BLE borad somewhere in my shop, I have no idea on how to use it though.

## Themes
Black and Neon Blue

## Release Information
Fee: Free with product purchase
Trial: N/A
Release Date: TBA
